# Sadaqah – Smart Donation Management System

Sadaqah is a web-based donation management platform designed to connect donors with verified orphanages and charitable organizations through a simple, secure, and transparent process.

This project is currently under development.

Future versions of Sadaqah aim to expand across India to help prevent donation-related scams and ensure that genuine help reaches the right hands.

Project Vision:

“Technology should not only connect people, it should protect generosity.  
Sadaqah is built to ensure every donation reaches the deserving, eliminating scams in the name of charity across India.”
